# Shrinking_COCO_Dataset
This projects aims to shrink COCO dataset for personal Machine Learning training. 

COCO training dataset has 118288 images and validation dataset has 5000 images. This amounts are too much for my ML project, so I need to shrink them down.

The training and test dataset will be taken from COCOtrain12017, while COCO has its own test dataset, I took it from training becuase test does no have annotations.

Tools used in this repository is FiftyOne.

Some chunks is randomly taken from COCO dataset, so your result would not be the same as mine.
